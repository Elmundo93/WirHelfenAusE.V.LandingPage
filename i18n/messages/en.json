However, making the payment can be worthwhile, as the pension insurance not only allows you to register for a state-subsidized Riester pension, but also counts fully towards your waiting period. \n\n Rehabilitation benefits are also covered provided at least six months of contributions have been made in the last two years. If the insured person is completely unable to work, there is also the option of applying for a disability pension. \n\n For more details, read this [article](https://magazin.minijob-zentrale.de/minijob-rentenversicherung/) from the Minijobzentrale.",
