        "text": "As a helping hand, you have the option of being exempted from compulsory pension insurance, meaning no further taxes are deducted from your salary. While this leaves more money in your pocket, you forgo the opportunity to make early contributions to your pension insurance. The exemption will be submitted by mail with this letter. However, making the payment can be worthwhile, as the pension insurance not only allows you to register for a state-subsidized Riester pension, but also counts fully towards your waiting period. Rehabilitation benefits are also covered provided at least six months of contributions have been made in the last two years. If the insured person is completely unable to work, there is also the option of applying for a disability pension. For more details, read this article from the Minijobzentrale.",
